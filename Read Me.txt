Radio Programing automation in Winamp
by Skyler Fly-Wilson
This script automates the playback of scheduled programing, for radio stations using Winamp. You can schedule shows, playlists and drops as well as setup a default playlist. The schedule is setup in the schedule.xml file.

Here is the heirarchy of the schedule xml file.

The schedule tag encloses the event tags.
There are four types of event tags, show, playlist, drop and default.

Here is a show tag. It defines a show named example, scheduling the file stream.pls, Sunday from 11 AM to 3 PM and a priority of 2.
The file can be any audio or playlist file, including streams.
Day codes can be writen as a list of three letter abreviations, a specific date can be writen as month/day/year or All for any day
Time values start and end are in 24 hour time
The show with the lowest priority level will take presidence
<show name="example">
	<file path="stream.pls" />
	<day code="Sun"/>
	<time start="11:00" end="15:00" />
	<priority>1</priority>
</show>

Playlist tags are pretty much the same as a show
<playlist name="Noon-Midnight">
	<file path="All.m3u" />
	<day code="All"/>
	<time start="12:00" end="24:00" />
	<priority>2</priority>
</playlist>

Drop tags play when a playlist or the default is running
The file tag contains a path to the drop or playlist of drops
The day tag works the same as in show an playlist tags
The freq tag sets the frequency in minutes for a drop to play
<drop name="clips" >
	<file path="clips.m3u" />
	<day code="All"/>
	<freq>10</freq>
</drop>

Default tags just contain a file tag, with the path for a default playlist file.
<default>
	<file path="animals.m3u" />
</default>

These are the steps to setup the automation script
1: setup up the schedule xlm file 
2: use task scheduler to schedule the automation.bat script to run on startup
3: start the automation.bat script
