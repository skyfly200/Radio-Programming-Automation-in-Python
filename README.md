# Radio-Programming-Automation-in-Python
built and tested on python 2.7

currently only for use on windows with winamp

to use the programing automation scripts you will need to use task scheduler

also must have python 2.x installed for these scripts to work


# Instructions for Use
Open task scheduler and create a new task, titleing it 
set the action set to run the "Automation.py" script or "Automation.bat" batch file from this library
set the task to trigger on start up and then to run again every 10 minutes

refer to Read Me.txt for info on programing the automation scripts schedule in xml
